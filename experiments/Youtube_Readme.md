random-youtube_comments.py: describe used approach


This code imports the pandas library and a module called youtube_API, creates an instance of the youtube_API class, prompts the user to input a video ID, retrieves the comments from the YouTube video with the given ID using the youtube_API method "get_comments_from", converts the comments to a pandas series, and saves the series as a CSV file with a filename based on the video ID. In summary, this code fetches comments from a YouTube video and stores them in a CSV file for further analysis.
