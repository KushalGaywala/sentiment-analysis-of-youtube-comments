## utilzed libraries: 
- pandas: used to clean up the data 

## used dataset 
We use the Movies and TV [amazon reviews dataset](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) from the following paper:

1) https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html - for the pipelining of the data and more traditional models.
2) https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials - To train the data 
3) We studied about the sickit learn tutorial/implemented it/learning the usage of the sickit learn for the vectorization and training the data set. 

Date: 20/11/22

1) We continued to study scikit learn and its usage for text analysis.

Date 12/11/22

1) We studied about Fitting and predicting: estimator basics
2) Transformers and pre-processors
3) Pipelines: chaining pre-processors and estimators
4) Model evaluation


Next steps would be: We would like to train the model using vector machines.

Rishab and Jonathan:
We are going to use linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) for our classification problem.
They are considered among the best models for Sentiment Analysis.
We are going to use the data set for training and hyperparameter tuning of the SVM.
The SVM should than be tested on comments from YouTube.
