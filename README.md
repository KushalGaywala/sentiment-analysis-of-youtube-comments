1) https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html - for the pipelining of the data and more traditional models.
2) https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials - To train the data 
3) We studied about the sickit learn tutorial/implemented it/learning the usage of the sickit learn for the vectorization and training the data set.

1) Tried many ways by which I can read and process such huge dataset in my computer.
2) Methods I tried to use:
	a) Spliting the data
	b) Installed a linux distro and used swap memory(10GB) as extension to RAM(8GB) but it also didn't worked.
3) Atlast after unable to find a feasible method. We settled on the idea to use reduced dataset.

1) Now I just used a single file from the multiple splited to do the pre-processing and tesitng of the code.
